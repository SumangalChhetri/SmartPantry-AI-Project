# SmartPantry - Recipe Preparation Agent Project Summary

## Overview
SmartPantry is an AI-powered cooking assistant developed for the IBM AI & Cloud Internship, designed to reduce food waste and simplify home cooking. The system leverages IBM Granite Foundation Models and Watsonx AI Studio to generate personalized recipe recommendations based on available ingredients.

## Key Technologies
- **IBM Granite Foundation Models**: For natural language understanding and recipe generation
- **IBM Watsonx AI Studio**: Model orchestration and deployment platform
- **RAG Architecture**: Retrieval Augmented Generation for intelligent recipe matching
- **Agentic AI with LangChain**: Autonomous decision-making and substitution logic
- **Python Ecosystem**: Pandas, Scikit-learn, Streamlit for data processing and UI

## Core Features
The system processes user ingredients through advanced NLP, retrieves relevant recipes using vector-based similarity matching, and generates step-by-step cooking instructions. It provides smart ingredient substitutions for missing items and adapts recommendations based on dietary preferences and restrictions.

## Dataset & Implementation
Built with comprehensive datasets containing 12+ user profiles and 20+ diverse recipes spanning Indian and international cuisines. The implementation includes a Jupyter notebook demonstrating the complete AI pipeline, a Streamlit web application for user interaction, and detailed documentation with architectural diagrams.

## Impact & Innovation
SmartPantry demonstrates how cloud-native AI can transform everyday cooking by making it more sustainable, accessible, and personalized. The project showcases practical applications of IBM's enterprise AI technologies in solving real-world problems while promoting food waste reduction and culinary creativity.
